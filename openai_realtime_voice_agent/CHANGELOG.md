# Changelog

All notable changes to this add-on. Newest first.

## 0.16.6 (fork)

- **Fixed: direct `ask_openclaw` silently rebinding to the HA MCP path.**
  pipecat registers a handler for every MCP tool during session creation,
  which overwrote the native direct-path handler — resurrecting the 60-second
  MCP cap ("it failed" while the task actually succeeded). Native registration
  now happens after MCP registration and wins.
- **Announce endpoint repeat guard**: near-duplicate messages within 10
  minutes are accepted but not spoken (`duplicate_suppressed`), so an agent
  monitoring for a result can't re-announce the same news every poll cycle.

## 0.16.5 (fork)

- **Voice prints now build automatically** when enrollment completes — the
  coach confirms out loud, warns when the enrolled name isn't in
  `speaker_male_name`/`speaker_female_name` (recognition stays inactive until
  it is), and asks for a retry when there wasn't enough clear speech.
  Previously this required a manual `python3 -m app.build_voiceprint` step
  that was easy to miss, leaving enrollments silently ineffective.
- New `sensor.voicepe_<instance>_voice_prints`: enrolled prints, with an
  `active` attribute showing which are enrolled *and* configured.

## 0.16.4 (fork)

- **Cost observability**: every response's exact token usage (from the API's
  `response.done`) is logged with an estimated cost, and a
  `sensor.voicepe_<instance>_openai_cost_today` sensor tracks daily spend in
  Home Assistant. Rates auto-switch for mini models.
- Recommended default applied to our install: `max_output_tokens: 1200` —
  output audio is the dominant per-turn meter ($64/1M tokens, measured); a cap
  bounds runaway monologues without touching normal replies.

## 0.16.3 (fork)

- Documentation overhaul: marketing README, `docs/` (getting started,
  configuration reference, features, agent integration, FAQ); repository
  renamed to `voicepe-realtime` (old URLs redirect). `repository.json` now
  carries this project's identity (was still the upstream fork's).
- `enrollment_phrase` default is now "hey leonard" (matches the shipped
  default wake word); HA UI help text added for all fork options.

## 0.16.2 (fork)

- **Guaranteed report-back on long delegations**: ask_openclaw now sends the
  instance name as `room`; the bridge answers "still working" at 120s instead
  of killing the turn, and delivers the agent's eventual answer to that room's
  announce endpoint itself. Previously a >145s research task was reported as
  a failure by voice while the agent kept working with nowhere to deliver.

## 0.16.1 (fork)

- **`recall_memory` tool** (with `openclaw_url`): instant deterministic search
  of the agent's memory files via the bridge (`{"recall": query}` →
  `{"matches": [...]}`). Registered as the FIRST stop for personal/household
  recall; `ask_openclaw` becomes the deep fallback. Fixes recall being a
  40-80s agent turn that found or missed facts depending on phrasing.

## 0.16.0 (fork)

- **Announce endpoint** (`announce_port` + `announce_token` options): a LAN
  route back to the device for the household's external agent. POST
  `/announce {"message": "..."}` (bearer-authed) speaks the message through
  the device's guarded TTS lane — the same path timers use — so a delegated
  task ("research X") can report back by voice minutes later. Disabled unless
  both options are set; 503 when no device is connected.

## 0.15.1 (fork)

- **Direct OpenClaw escalation** (`openclaw_url` option): `ask_openclaw` now
  calls the bridge endpoint directly instead of going through HA's MCP server,
  whose hardcoded 60-second request timeout killed longer agent turns (deep
  memory recall, contact lookups). Direct calls get ~2.5 minutes. Unset, the
  MCP-script path is used unchanged. The speaker gate applies either way.
- (0.10–0.15.0 entries — speaker voice-prints, timers, enrollment v2, HA
  sensors, false-wake flagging, voice-instructed memory — are in git history.)

## 0.9.0 (fork)

- **Firmware-backed voice enrollment** (pairs with firmware commit 5095ed0+):
  the device enters a true enrollment mode — mic pinned open, wake/stop models
  disarmed, cyan breathing LED, 10-minute hard cap, center button as physical
  escape — while an automated audio coach (gpt-4o-mini-tts prompts, cached,
  pushed down the speaker lane on a fixed schedule) guides 25 varied wake-phrase
  repetitions plus 90 s of natural speech. Mic audio flows ONLY to the recorder
  during enrollment: OpenAI hears nothing, so no VAD commits, no forced
  responses, no cost, no conversation mechanics to fight. New options:
  `enrollment_phrase`, `enrollment_tts_voice`.

## 0.8.0 (fork)

- **Voice enrollment**: say "I want to teach you my voice" — the assistant runs
  a guided recording session (varied wake-phrase repetitions + natural speech)
  via the new `voice_enrollment` tool, capturing the raw device mic stream to
  `/share/voice-enrollment/<person>_<timestamp>.wav` (16 kHz mono, 15-minute
  safety cap, persists across rebuilds). One session yields wake-word training
  positives AND voice-print enrollment audio. Recordings are personal data and
  are not managed by the add-on beyond writing the file.

## 0.7.1 (fork)

- Speaker probe tuned for real device audio (live test found 3-7 voiced frames
  in actual speech vs 100+ on synthetic bench audio): YIN threshold 0.15 → 0.20
  with a moderate-periodicity argmin fallback, energy gate 0.15 → 0.08 of peak
  RMS, minimum voiced frames 12 → 8, capture window 2.5 s → 3.0 s. Synthetic
  bench unchanged (0% wrong on typical voices).
- Debug: when `enable_recording` is on, each probe capture is saved to
  `recordings/probe_*.wav` for offline threshold calibration.

## 0.7.0 (fork)

- **Speaker context v1**: optional voice-type (male/female) detection for a
  two-person household. On every wake the first ~2.5 s of command audio is
  classified by median pitch (pure numpy YIN, in-process, off the event loop;
  benched at 98.6% right / 0% wrong across 11 typical synthetic voices) and the
  verdict is injected into the Realtime session as a system item, so the
  assistant can address the speaker by name ("sir"/"ma'am") and hedge when
  uncertain. New options: `speaker_male_name`, `speaker_female_name` (both
  empty = feature off).
- **Speaker-gated tools**: `male_only_tools` (comma-separated tool names) are
  enforced below the model — gated tools return a polite refusal unless the
  last voice verdict is the male speaker. Fails closed on uncertain/stale
  verdicts. Convenience gating, not biometric auth.

## 0.6.0

> ⚠️ **This update has two parts — please update both:**
> 1. **This add-on** (the update you're installing now).
> 2. **The Voice PE firmware** — open **ESPHome Device Builder** and click **Update** (or **Install**) on your device.
>
> The device and the add-on use one shared protocol; updating only one half can cause odd behaviour.

A reliability and voice-control polish release.

**Stop word**

- **Saying "stop" now usually works on the first try.** The spoken "stop" could
  previously be answered by the assistant a moment later, so you sometimes had to
  repeat it; that follow-on reply is now cancelled, so a single "stop" is
  typically enough.
- **Saying "stop" during a web search returns the device to rest promptly** — the
  light ring no longer keeps showing the "replying" animation for several seconds.
- **Fewer accidental stops** on the assistant's own speech.
- The light ring briefly flashes **red** to confirm your "stop" was registered. *(firmware)*

**Reliability**

- **No more unresponsive sessions.** A silently dropped connection to OpenAI is
  now detected and repaired within seconds, instead of leaving the assistant deaf
  until a restart.
- **The roughly hourly reconnect now happens proactively during a quiet moment**,
  so it practically never interrupts a conversation.
- **Smart-home commands are no longer cancelled** if you keep talking while they run.
- The light can no longer get **stuck on "thinking"**, and long web searches get
  all the time they need.

**No more "answers out of nowhere"**

- The assistant no longer occasionally replies — or repeats its previous answer —
  right after the wake word when you said nothing.
- A sentence that got cut off is no longer answered minutes later on your next wake.

**Settings**

- New **"Wake mic delay"** setting: a short pause after the wake chime before the
  mic opens, so the chime can't be mistaken for speech (default 700 ms).
- The **"Follow-up mic delay"** default is now **700 ms**. Existing installs keep
  their saved value — raise yours if the assistant ever answers right after its
  own reply.

## 0.5.0

A big stable release: everything built and tested on the dev channel over the
past days. **Also update the Voice PE firmware** (v1.1.0 — one click in ESPHome
Builder) to get the full effect of the "stop" improvements; the two halves
work best together.

- **"Stop" now works through the whole reply AND the after-reply listening
  window.** The device detects the word more reliably, and the bridge treats
  it as authoritative: in-flight audio is discarded and an answer OpenAI had
  already started for the stop word itself is cancelled on arrival — no more
  "Okay, I'll be quiet" replies to your "stop".
- **Fixed: an answer could cut off mid-sentence, after which the assistant
  went deaf** until the next reconnect. Harmless protocol races (e.g. your
  sentence being split into two turns by a pause) no longer kill the session.
- **Fixed an audio race that could inject noise/hiss into replies** (firmware,
  paired with this release).
- **Mute behaves properly now** (firmware): the ring goes dark with red
  markers by the microphones, and muting also ends an open listening window
  immediately — both from Home Assistant and with the physical side switch.
- **The LED Ring switch in Home Assistant works again** (firmware): entity off
  = device dark at rest; entity on = the gentle "ready" pulse.
- **Completely reworked Configuration tab**: options grouped logically
  (Basics → Model & voice → Conversation → Web search → Audio →
  Home Assistant → Advanced), every description rewritten in plain practical
  language, and a full Dutch translation included (shown automatically when
  your HA is set to Dutch). Confusing or broken switches were removed; rarely
  needed expert fields stay hidden until you need them.
- **The add-on now has its own icon.**
- Friendlier defaults for new installs: follow-up mic delay 200 ms and
  playback buffer 150 ms. **Existing installs keep their saved values** — if
  yours still say 0, consider setting 200/150 manually (Conversation / Audio
  groups) for fewer ghost triggers and less crackle.

### Heads-up: the firmware stub template was improved

The per-device stub in ESPHome Builder used to reference the firmware in a
form that lets ESPHome **cache the downloaded YAML for a day** — clicking
Update shortly after a release could then silently rebuild yesterday's code.
The stub templates in the firmware repo are fixed; existing users can apply
the same fix once by replacing **only the `packages:` block** in their
device's YAML in ESPHome Builder (everything else — your name, secrets,
`dashboard_import` — stays exactly the same):

```yaml
packages:
  realtime:
    url: https://github.com/TristanBrotherton/voicepe-realtime-firmware
    ref: main
    files: [home-assistant-voice.realtime.yaml]
    refresh: 0s
```

Current templates for reference:
[esphome-builder.dhcp.yaml](https://github.com/TristanBrotherton/voicepe-realtime-firmware/blob/main/esphome-builder.dhcp.yaml) ·
[esphome-builder.static-ip.yaml](https://github.com/TristanBrotherton/voicepe-realtime-firmware/blob/main/esphome-builder.static-ip.yaml)

## 0.4.26

- **Web search is now ON by default**, using **gpt-5.5** (the best-quality search
  model), so the assistant can look things up online — weather, news, facts — out
  of the box. **Existing installs keep their saved setting**: if you had it off,
  switch `enable_web_search` on (and set `web_search_model` to `gpt-5.5`) in the
  add-on Configuration. The cheaper mini/nano models stay available.

## 0.4.25

- **Fix:** the first thing you said in the few seconds right after an automatic
  reconnect (e.g. after the 60-minute session cap) could be ignored
  (`conversation_already_has_active_response`). The reconnected session no longer
  creates a duplicate response, so that turn answers normally.

## 0.4.24

- **Renamed** to **OpenAI Realtime 2 Voice Agent**.
- Rewrote the store/info description and added a full **Documentation** tab
  (install steps, OpenAI key, Home Assistant MCP setup, recommended settings, web
  search, credits). Removed stale text from the original upstream client.
- Default system prompt is now an English, voice-tuned prompt (silent tool calls,
  varied confirmations, language pinning). Your own saved prompt is not changed.
- Default `follow_up_open_delay_ms` and `playback_prebuffer_ms` set to `0` (raise
  them if the device hears its own tail or you hear crackle).

## 0.4.23

- **Fix:** the 60-minute session cap sometimes left the session dead until a
  restart. It now reconnects automatically in all cases (both the keepalive-drop
  and the `session_expired` forms).

## 0.4.22

- **New options:** voice **speed** (0.25–1.5), **max reply length**
  (`max_output_tokens`), and **input noise reduction** (off / near-field /
  far-field). All default to current behaviour.

## 0.4.21

- Model, voice, web-search-model and transcription-model options are now
  **dropdowns** with the known-good values, each with a **custom** entry if you
  need a value not in the list.

## 0.4.20

- **New:** optional **web search**. Turn on `enable_web_search` to let the
  assistant look things up online (weather, news, facts). Uses your OpenAI key;
  off by default. Model configurable via `web_search_model` (default gpt-5.4-mini).

## 0.4.19

- Clarified the MCP option help text for both the built-in HA MCP Server and the
  unofficial ha-mcp add-on.

## 0.4.18

- **Fix:** removed a meaningless filler reply ("I'm ready to continue…") that could
  appear on the first turn of a session.

## 0.4.17

- **Fix:** cap restored conversation history (`max_context_messages`, default 12) to
  bound per-turn token cost and avoid hitting OpenAI's rate limit.

## 0.4.16

- **Fix:** the device no longer gets stuck blinking "thinking" after a turn-ending
  error (e.g. a rate limit) — it returns to idle so you can retry.

## 0.4.14

- **New:** `playback_prebuffer_ms` jitter buffer to reduce occasional crackle at the
  start of replies.

## 0.4.12 – 0.4.13

- **Fix:** "say stop, then immediately ask again → silence". Disabled the broken
  server-side audio truncation that wedged the next turn.

## 0.4.9 – 0.4.11

- **New:** auto-reconnect the OpenAI Realtime session when its connection drops
  (keepalive timeout / 60-minute cap), instead of going dead until a restart.
  Refined so a normal device disconnect doesn't trigger an unnecessary reconnect.

## 0.4.6 – 0.4.8

- **New:** configurable post-reply **follow-up listening window** (answer back
  without re-saying the wake word) + its open-delay, and per-option help text in the
  UI.
- **New:** the assistant's and user's transcripts are logged to the add-on log
  (`🤖 assistant:` / `🗣️ user:`).

## 0.4.0 – 0.4.4

- **Fix:** resample the device's 16 kHz mic to the 24 kHz OpenAI requires (garbled
  speech), and drop empty audio chunks.
- **New:** device **"stop"** interrupt now actually cancels the reply and clears
  buffered audio.

## 0.3.x

- Switched the target to **gpt-realtime-2**, pinned pipecat-ai 0.0.97, and tuned
  turn detection (semantic VAD), phase delivery to the device, and the startup
  sequence to stop double-responses. Made the disconnect tool and transcription
  model configurable.

## Earlier

- Initial pipecat + WebSocket implementation (forked from
  [fjfricke/ha-openai-realtime](https://github.com/fjfricke/ha-openai-realtime)).
